                <h2>LEAN<em>-MANUFACTURING :</em></h2>
                <p class="text-content">Lean manufacturing, or lean management, is a system derived from the Japanese school of
                  organisation. Applied by many companies around the world, following in the footsteps of Toyota in
                  particular, lean, properly understood, enables sustainable improvements and major
                  transformations within companies. <br><br>
                  We can help you lay the foundations for your standards and acquire in-depth knowledge of your
                  organisation (operating methods and times). On this basis, we can then help you build the pillars of
                  your ‘Toyota house’, using continuous improvement cycles (PDCA): just-in-time, automation, visual
                  communication, etc.<br><br>
                  The Lean 4.0 training cycle we offer gives you the complete knowledge you need to run a lean
                  project, with the new tools and orientation of Industry 4.0. We also provide our customers with lean
                  manufacturing consultancy services:<br><br>
                  • On in-depth projects to implement the lean mindset within the company. Lean is not just a
                  toolbox. It&#39;s more of a philosophy, a state of mind, which gradually takes root in the
                  organisation, becoming natural and lasting over time. <br><br>
                  <br>• On more specific subjects, to deal with a more specific problem: definition and improvement of operating times, balancing, workstation organisation, TPM, SMED, 5S, etc. B&B ISM publishes and maintains a Lean knowledge base.

                <h2>INDUSTRIAL<em>-PROJECTS: </em></h2>
                <p class="text-content">The market, regulations and innovations sometimes force us to review our industrial facilities :<br><br>
                  • Installation of a new machine<br>
                  • New warehouse<br>
                  • Workshop relocation<br>
                  • New building<br>
                  • …<br>
                  <br>
                  An industrial project of this type is critical, both financially and strategically. It cannot be managed in
                  the same way as routine operations, because of its duration, the concentration of resources, change
                  management, relations with subcontractors, and the heterogeneity of the actions to be carried out:<br><br>
                  • Preparing, organising and planning the project (issues, resources, responsibilities, schedule, stakeholders, communication, decision-making, steering, etc.)<br>
                  • Monitor implementation (progress/delays, critical path, site meetings, coordination, change management, links with suppliers, etc.)<br>
                  • Preparing for production start-up (training, recruitment, change management, action closure, documentation, capitalisation, etc.)<br><br>
                  An industrial project is not just a technical project. It often requires action in the field of :<br><br>

                  • Safety: during the works, but also during operation, ergonomic impact, etc.<br>
                  • Finance: profitability, monitoring costs, supplier invoices, etc.<br>
                  • Marketing: coordination with R&amp;D, the supply chain and sales, to ensure that the industrial project is in phase with market expectations.<br>
                  • HR: recruitment, training, information for employee representatives, job organisation, etc.<br>
                  • Strategy: alignment with the company&#39;s strategy and policy, and with the initial challenges.<br>
                  • Regulations: authorisations, permits, regulations, standards, etc.<br>
                  • Quality: risk/opportunity analysis, product/process impact (FMEA), procedures and operating methods, control plan, etc.<br>
                  • All other related departments: reorganisation of maintenance, methods, logistics, design office, etc.<br><br>
                  We have successfully completed a number of industrial projects of varying sizes. We can help you organise and monitor your own projects, as project manager or batch leader, or upstream, as PMO
                  (Project Management Officer), in order to define the organisation, methods and tools for project management within the company.

                <p class="text-content">
                  The supply chain is at the heart of the industrial process. Optimising flows is a major challenge:<br><br>
                  • At both organisational and strategic levels: S&amp;OP process, organisation of pull and push
                  flows, planning and launching of production orders, etc.<br>
                  • But also in the field: information processing, in-process management, implementation of kanbans, operating times, production losses due to bottlenecks, etc.<br><br>
                  B&amp;B ISM provides its know-how, tools and experience in these areas. If the project requires it, we can build a dynamic simulation of the flows concerned. We are a distributor and integrator of FlowSim simulation software.

                <p class="text-content">
                  We can help you set up the organisation to move towards autonomous teams. This type of
                  organisation increases employees responsibility and interest in their work, helps them to find the
                  best ways of working and ways of improving, reduces hierarchical levels and improves
                  responsiveness and flexibility.<br><br>
                  We work on :<br><br>
                  • Taking stock of the current organisation of production teams, their degree of autonomy, the
                  challenges associated with this organisation, etc.<br>
                  • The road map for rolling out a new organisation: target, stages, schedule, etc.<br>
                  • The training required for employees and management.<br>
                  • Implementing tools and methods: responsibilities within the team, short-interval activities
                  (AIC, or ‘5-minute point’), visual management, etc.

                <h2>QUALITY /<em>- 6 SIGMA :</em></h2>
                <p class="text-content">
                  The costs associated with quality in the broadest sense are often much higher than those associated
                  with labour productivity, for example. Not only in terms of direct costs (loss of materials, for
                  example), but also indirect costs (customer satisfaction).

                  But it's not always easy to pinpoint the root causes. We can help you find and then deal with these
                  root causes, using different types of methodology:<br>
                  • Traditional root-cause analysis workgroups (PDCA cycles): quality meetings, brainstorming,
                  Ishikawa, 5M method, 5 Whys, Delphi method, etc.<br>
                  • Through a 6 sigma project: using the DMAIC methodology, we define the problem and its
                  challenges together, then we use 6 sigma statistical methods to measure the respective
                  impact of the various possible causes.

                  Against a backdrop of increasing digitalisation of the business world (cf. the digital factory, Industry
                  4.0, digital continuity, etc.), MES (Manufacturing Execution System) tools are becoming more and
                  more prevalent in companies. Providing the link between management systems (ERP, PLM, APS, etc.)
                  and the field (sensors, PLCs, supervision, operator input, etc.), they are at the heart of the connected
                  factory.<br><br>
                  Our knowledge of the MES ecosystem (or MOM: Manufacturing Operations Management) enables us
                  to support companies in their MES projects in two main areas:<br><br>
                  • Project management assistance: advice on integrating MES into the IS, helping to draw up
                  specifications, choose a solution and manage the implementation project.<br>
                  • Project management for MES solution integration projects (analysis and functional
                  specifications, training, configuration, start-up support, etc.).
